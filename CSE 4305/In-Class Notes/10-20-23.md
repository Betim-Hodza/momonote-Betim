New line as a separator vs new line as the end of a line
For persons who interpret new line as a separator, if there is a new line at the end of the file, the file actually has an empty line at the end of it.

\n as a separator 
Example:
```
1\n
2\n
3\n
4
```
There are 4 lines in the file. There are 7 characters.

\n as a terminator
Example:  
```
1\n
2\n
3\n
4\n
```
There are 4 lines in the file. There are 8 characters.
