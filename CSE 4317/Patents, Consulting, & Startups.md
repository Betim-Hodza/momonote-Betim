# Patents - Exlusive rights granted for an invention

**Provisional Patents**  
*Patent Pending means that someone applied for a provisional patent or full patent*
*Patent Pending is more of a marketing term. It does not mean that it has been reviewed or approved*
*If you are serious about applying for a full patent, you'll go through a patent attorney*  
*Your provisional patent will be timestamped, but not looked at for another year*  

*If you do it yourself, and then later decide to get an attorney, and try to make the provisional patent to a full patent, it will make the attorney's job harder. If you are serious, go through a lawyer*  

**Full patents**  
*As an example, McMurroughs patent costed about 6 to 10 thousand dollars*  
*You can say that your invention is "Patent Pending"*  

**Patents at UTA**  
Innovation & Commercialization  
*If you invent something as part of research with UTA, the downside is that they own it. The upside is that the patent process is much smoother, and that you might get money back from licensing.*

# Patents - Ways to profit from them  
Commercialization  

Licensing  

Selling a patent  

Liigation (Patent trolling)  
*A patent troll is to gobble up patents, and sue people that may be infringing on their patents*  

*In East Texas and in Delaware, there were courts that were very friendly to patent litigates. They can essentially select the judge. The supreme court struck this down. The patent trolls can no longer select the court they would like the trial to take place in.*  

# Consulting    
*I want to draw a difference between being a contractor and a consultant. A contractor is more like a regular full time employee, that is working for a designated period of time. But for the most part they work in the same office as a full time employee. They are just set their for a specific amount of time.*  

*When you are a consultant, you are essentially a hired gun. You are an expert that is coming to solve a high interest problem that the client does not have the in house knowledge for, or does not have the bandwidth to spare, and doesn't want to hire a full time employee.*  

# Consulting (pros and cons)  
*I will show you data for high compensation rates*  
*If you are a good consultant, you are typically working on cutting edge stuff. If you are consulting, and you are not respected as an expert, you may not be doing it right.*  

*I've worked on hydraulics, more interesting things than I otherwise would've been exposed to*  

*You are responsible for your own accounting, marketing. It is very reputation based*

*When you've had maybe two to five years of industry experience. Immediately after graduation is not typically the right time to start*  

Risk of getting ripped off if you are not careful  
*As an example, a company ran out money, and they were going to pay the consultant with money that they had not secured yet. When the consultants submitted the last invoices, the consultants were owed several thousand dollars in unpaid consulting works. They had gotten paid everything that they had worked before then, so it was a net positive.*  
*It is illegal to garnish wages, but consultants are much less protected. There are ways to be smarter about this. Always set invoices for a set amount of time. Have a clause set invoice due in a certain number of days.*  

# How much to charge?  
You can bill hourly, daily, flat rate, etc  
Billing by the project (flat rate) is risky 

Setting rates based on "what you think is fair" is risky  
*IEE MEMBERSHIP REPORT is very worth buying*  
*IEE-USA CONSULTANTS FEE SURVEY REPORT*  
*76% bill hourly*  

*I can't stress show important these documenta are to have access to if you are a consultant*  


# Startups  
How an idea becomes a company  
Many successful tech companies were once startups  

*Not all tech companies were tech startups*  
*TI had a defense branch within their company. They did a lot of defense stuff. TI at some point sold off their defense stuff in the late 90s, and that later became Raytheon. Raytheon never went through a startup phase, they spun off from a different company*  

# The "startup path"  
*If you google the "startup path" you will see this image. It is a good reference*  

*If you are founder and you ride that down all the way to IPO, you are making crazy money.*  

*I've exited closer to the middle of the stack*  

# How Startup Funding Works  
*We are always trying to sell equity in the company so that the pie grows.*  

100% of nothing is a lot less than 17% of a big company  

*Not all successful wealthy company go public. Some keep it public equity  

# The "Valley of Death"  

*You might have 6 months of runway. You are measuring things in terms of days or weeks*  
*To get money, you either need sales, or you go back to investors*  
*Once you become profitable, you can IPO. That is the dream of every company.*  
*You need enough runway to become profitable, or you die in the valley of death*  

# A tale of two technologies  

The first is one is actually something I did during my PhD. UTA owns this one.  

I got really into eye tracking a long time ago. Long story short, cool technology, tracks your eyes, creates a 3D map. The university patented it. Hopefully it gets licensed soon.  

This other technology was something I made in my garage. I've done a lot of computer vision. There isn't a good 3D industrial grade camera out there. We took an xbox kinect and implemented an edge processor, like an NVIDIA Ti. We'll build these cameras and sell them to industrial companies. We'll sell that.  

Only one of them got angel investor funding. 

The first project was intended for people suffering from ALS. It had a much smaller potential market, had to go through regulations, and a medical distributor. 

The second project convinced the first angel investor and there is a clear market. 

You always have to remember that angel investors don't care about how interesting your project. They only care about making money. There is a much better story for the roadmap to profitiability in the second project.   

The first patent may have more value to it now with Apple and other companies releasing headset technology.  

# Local Resources  
UTA Innovcation 
Paul Borsen is the new director.He has an impressive resume and is a very well connected person.  

TechFW
IIs a technology incubator, helps form companies around ideas and find investors.  
Offers (paid) startup classes  

If things go well, they will connect you with angel investors. you get told no a lot.  

The Founder's Arena (fintech / wealthtech)  
- *if you are interested in Mobile App, AI, etc, for fintech*  

**Learn Startup Jargon**  

# Questions
*How do you maintain and build a good clientele*  
Dial down on Facebook and dial up on the Linkedin  
One startup company got angel investors because they had a good Linkedin profile  

IEEE also has a consultants network. It may not be free, but it would be worth the money.  

The other thing is to attend professional networking events. You have to go talk to people an have a nice business card. Understand what their needs are. A lot of it is boots on the ground, handshaking etc.  

Having a good publication White papers you publish on your own is good too.  
When someone googles your name, they should 

*Could you tell us about Cloud9?*  
Cloud 9  
James was the cofounder  
Camera in box  
Still close with the cofounder.

What McMurrough learned:
Don't dilute, don't sell too many shares to one investor.  
He and I made enough money to make it worth our time. It was like the wild west, we have a lot of battle scars.

You could do the same thing that other people are doing, but you can do it cheaper and faster and be successful. If you infringe upon their patents or copyright, your company might get in trouble. Not you personall though.
