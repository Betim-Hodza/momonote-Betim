# Learning Objectives  

## 1. Describe the general function of DNA.
## 2. Name the parts of a nucleotide.
## 3. Identify which parts of a nucleotide are involved in phosphodiester bonds & hydrogen bonds.
## 4. Use the sequence of one DNA strand to predict the sequence of its complementary strand. 
## 5. Name the functional groups found at the 5’ & 3’ ends of a DNA strand.
## 6. Explain the importance of the 3’ end of a DNA strand in the process of DNA replication.
## 7. Explain what is meant by “semiconservative replication”.
## 8. Describe the role of origins of replication, replication bubbles, and replication forks in the process of DNA replication.
## 9. Describe the role of each of the major enzymes involved in DNA replication.
## 10. Explain why the leading strand of DNA is made continuously while the lagging strand is not.
