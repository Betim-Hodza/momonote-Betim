## Overview of the Process of DNA Replication  

New nucleotides can only be added to a three-prime end.  
Because the strands are anti-parallel, the three-prime end
- is facing the replication fork on the leading strand  
- is facing away from the replication fork on the lagging strand

## Step 2: Build Complementary DNA  
 
**How do we denature DNA strands in the lab?**    
Temperature  

The DNA polymerase we use in the lab is called **taq polymerase**.  
 
If we use regular polymerase, the polymerase is going to degrade as the temperature goes up.  
We find a polymerase that can withstand high temperatures from a bacteria called **Taq Thermus Aquaticus**  

**CRISPER/Cas9**  
Major revolution in biotechnology
Allows you to cut specific pieces of DNA
Where does CRISPER/Cas9 come from?  
Bacteria have a self defense system.
We borrow from the bacteria in the same way we borrow the polymerase from the Taq Thermus Aquaticus.  
We discover these tools when we study biology diversity.

I might give you a replicate bubble like thise.
I might only give you the replication strand.  
Maybe I'm only showing you a strand.  
I will ask you, is that going to be leading strand or a lagging strand.  

Identify where the prime end is, understand that it's antiparallel, and identify which it is.
