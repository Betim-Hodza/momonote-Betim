# Homework Answers  

Identify which phase of mitosis is described by each of the statements below.  
**Anaphase**  
This is the phase when the sister chromatids are detached from one another.  
**Telophase**  
This is the phase when a new nuclear membrane begins to form around the divided chromosomes.
**Metaphase**  
This is the phase when the chromosomes line up along the center of the cell.  
**Prophase**  
This is the phase when DNA condenses into chromosomes. 
This is the phase when the nuclear membrane begins to break down. \
