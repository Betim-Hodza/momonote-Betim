# Lecture 8

**prokaryotic genomes**
- large chromosome
- smaller plasmids


**eukaryotics genomes**
- pairs of chromosomes in nucleus
- circular chromosome in mitochondria
- circular chromosome in chloroplasts

**homologous chromosomes**
- "matching" pairs of chromosomes
- contain the same genes at the same position
- one chromosome from the mother
- one chromosome from the father

**alleles**
different versions of the same gene

**diploid cells**
- 2 of each chromosome
- 1 chromosome from each parent

**diploid cell example**
- somatic cells

**somatic cells**
include all cells EXCEPT gametes

**haploid**
- cells have 1 of each chromosome

**haploid cell example**
- gametes

**chromosomes**  
- a threadlike structure of nucleic acids and protein 
- found in the nucleus of most living cells
- carries genetic information in the form of genes.

**sister chromatids**  
- identical copies (chromatids) 
- formed by the DNA replication of a chromosome
- both copies joined together by a common centromere

**chromatin**
- make up chromosomes
- consists of protein, RNA, and DNA

**cell cycle**  
1. interphase
2. mitotic phase

**interphase**  
1. G1 Phase
2. S Phase
3. G2 Phase

**mitotic phase**  
1. prophase
2. prometaphase
3. metaphase
4. anaphase
5. telophase
6. cytokinesis

**G1 Phase**  
- first gap
- lttle change is visible
- the cell is accumulating 
    - building blocks of chromosomal DNA
    - associated proteins
    - energy reserves

**S Phase**  
- formation of sister chromatids
- each chromosome is made of two sister chromatids and is a duplicated chromosome
- the centrosome is duplicated
- the two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle
