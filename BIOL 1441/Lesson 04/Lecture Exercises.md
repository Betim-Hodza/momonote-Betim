|    | Location|Starts with  |Ends with | Stored Forms of Energy (ATP, NADH, or FADH2)|
|------------|-------------|--------------|--|--|
|Glycolysis          |Cytoplasm|glucose (C 6H 12O6) + 2 ATP + 2 NAD+|2 pyruvate (C 3H 4O3) + 2 (net) ATP + 2 NADH  | ATP |
|Pyruvate oxidation|mitochondrial matrix|2 pyruvate + 2 NAD+ + 2 Coenzyme A complexes|2 acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) + 2 CO2 + 2 NADH| NADH|
|Citric Acid Cycle|mitochondrial matrix| 2 acetyl CoA + 6 NAD+ + 2 FAD (+ oxaloacetate )|oxaloacetate + 4 CO2 + 2 ATP + 6NADH + 2 FADH2| FADH2|

## Lecture Notes
In **cellular respiration** the energy is transferred to the bonds between the phosphate groups ATP.

**ATP** can be used by cells as a source of energy by breaking the high-energy phosphate bonds.

The energy in glucose is stored in the chemical bonds between the atoms. It is not directly available for your cells to use.
