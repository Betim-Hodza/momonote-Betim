Lesson 1 Biology of You (1/25)----------------------------------------------
**Homework Assignment for Unit 1
 - lipids dont dissolve in water as they are non polar, mainly composed of hydrogen and carbon
   - phospholipids make up the plasma membrane
 - double bonds distinguishes UNSATURATED fatty acids from saturated fatty acids, these double bonds lead to the lipid bending
   - question on omega-6 fatty acid, it's the one on the left
Cholesterol 
 - its obtained from your diet but can also be made by the liver when fatty acid is metabolized
 - too much is bad for the body, but you need a certain amount for function
 - cholesterol is present in the plasma membrane along with phospholipids, heat causes the plasma membrane to speed up, the cholesterol acts as a buffer to slow down the plasma membrane

CATABOLIC vs ANABOLIC
 - Catabolic : when large molecules (lipids) are broken down into smaller pieces (monomers)
   - catabolic reactions release the stored energy for a cell to use
 - Anabolic : occur when smaller pieces are used to build a larger molecule
   - energy is required to connect smaller pieces together

CORTISOL
 - A sterol hormone released when stressed (aka a signaling hormone)
 - increases breakdown of glycogen (stored energy) in the body 
    - is catabolic as it triggers the breakdown of fat molecules which provides energy to the body
 - decreases building of new proteins
 * insulin is the opposite of cortisol making it anabolic

WATER CHEMICAL REACTIONS
 - polar covalent bonds : when there is unequal sharing of electrons, making the pull on shared bonds pull really hard, with a partial negative towards the oxygen and positive charge at the hydrogen
 - covalent bond : when atoms share electrons
 - HYDROLYSIS - a type of catabolic reaction where water is used to break a chemical bond
   - not just water is needed, there is also enzymes present that processes the reaction
 - DEHYDRATION SYNTHESIS - a type of anabolic reaction where water is made
   - both energy and enzymes are needed to process this reaction
   - H and OH are removed from the monomers which leads to a chemical bond held by an oxygen
Macromolecules : a summary
  Type               Function                                   Example
 - Lipids         : energy storage, insulation for the body   : fat
 - Proteins       : many=> enzymes, structural protein        : insulin
 - Carbohydrates  : main source of fat energy, energy storage : glucose
 - nucleic acids : stores genetic information, heredity      : RNA/DNA

Lesson 2 The Great Divide (1/25)----------------------------------------------
 - If an oxygen had a lot of oxygen, it's a polar molecule, which means it will dissolve in water
 - When you eat, the glucose in the food enters your blood, however the glucose can directly enter the plasma membrane of the cell, a transportation is needed to move glucose against its concentration gradient, transport protein helps move the glucose into the cell
   - there is a high concentration of sodium outside compared to the low concentration inside, so when there is a break, the high concentration of outside the cell gets diffused
ATOM STRUCTURE 
 - PROTONS and NEUTRONS concentrated in the nucleus and has a very low mass compared to the rest of the aton
 - the nucleus is surrounded by one or more negatively charged ELECTRONS
    - other subatomic molecules : quarks, god particle (higgs boson)
 - Covalent bonds is a type of chemical bond that is strong, electrons are shared between molecules
   - when bonds break, it releases energy ; when new bonds are formed, the energy is stored in the bond
   - a carbon hydrogen bond is, hydrophobic and nonpolar
  - Ionic bond, weaker than a covalent bond, where one atom donates an electron unlike covalent where the electron is shared
 - anything to do with water is relevant to hydrogen bonds such as surface tension
   - hydrogen bonds are weak bonds that can be split
ATP
 - ATP has a pentose sugar and a nitrogenous base (adenosine) with 3 phosphate groups : the name Adenosine triphosphate comes from this
    - when ATP gets energizes, the first phosphate group is removed, leaving us with Adenosine diphosphate (ADP)
    - LEFT HAS MORE CHEMICAL BONDS AS WELL AS MORE ENERGY

CELLS AND PLASMA MEMBRANE
 - Each plasma membrane has :
    - Cytosol
    - Extracellular fluid
  - is semi permeable
PHOSPHOLIPID BILAYER
 - two rows of phospholipids with both water-loving and water fearing, so both water and water-loving cant move easily
 - All heads are hydrophilic regions
 - all tails are hydrophobic regions

SELECTIVE PERMEABILITY
 - only certain molecules that match the chemical properties of the fatty acid tails can be diffused across the membrane
 - small polar molecules and gasses can pass freely, ex. O2 and CO2
     - small polar molecules cant pass larger fatty acid tails like glucose
