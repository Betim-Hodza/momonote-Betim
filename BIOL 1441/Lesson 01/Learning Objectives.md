# Learning Objectives  


**1. Explain the fundamentals of atomic structures and define a bond.**  

**2. Explain the main function of a cellâ€™s plasma membrane.**  

**3. Describe the functions of phospholipids & transport proteins in the plasma membrane.**  

**4. Identify the hydrophobic & hydrophilic regions of the phospholipid bilayer.** ***

**5. List the kinds of molecules that can & cannot diffuse across the membrane.**  ***  


**6. Use the chemical properties of a molecule (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, polar, nonpolar, charged) to determine whether or not it could diffuse across the membrane.** ***
| Molecule      | Diffuse   | 
|--------------|-----------|
| Hydrophobic | simple      |
| Nonpolar    | simple  |  
| Charged   | faciliated|
| Hydrophilic    | facilitated  |  
| Polar    | facilitated  |  
| Large    | facilitated  |

**7. Explain what a concentration gradient is.**  ***

**8. Use the direction of a concentration gradient to determine which way a molecule would move (into or out of a cell).** ***

**9. Explain how passive transport is different from active transport.**

**10.Explain why active transport is important to a cell.**  

**11.Identify similarities & differences between these transport processes: diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis, primary active transport, secondary active transport.** ***
