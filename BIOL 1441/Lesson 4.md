# Lesson 4 Notes
## Slide Notes
In **cellular respiration** the energy is transferred to the bonds between the phosphate groups ATP.

**ATP** can be used by cells as a source of energy by breaking the high-energy phosphate bonds.

The energy in glucose is stored in the chemical bonds between the atoms. It is not directly available for your cells to use.

## Homework Answers 
The **Citric Acid Cycle** (Krebs Cycle) builds ATP through **substrate-level phosphorylation**

Glycolysis starts with **glucose** and ends with **pyruvate**

In the chemical reaction above, Zn loses 2 electrons, transforming it into Zn^2+.
This means that Zn was **oxidized** in this chemical reaction.

Pyruvate oxidation starts with **pyruvate**, and ends with **acetyl coenzyme A**

A chemical reaction that *builds* a large polymer from small monomers is called **an anabolic** reaction.
Because this *building* reaction requires energy, this kind of reaction would also be considered **endergonic**.

*Pyruvate* oxidation occurs **in the mitochondrial matrix**

O2 (Oxygen) required by the *mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain* **accepts low-energy electrons and forms water.**

**NAD+** electron carrier does **NOT** transport electrons
**NADH** electron carrier **DOES** transport electrons

**Fermentation** generates **more NAD+**

In a chemical reaction, the molecule that gets **reduced** will form a *new chemical bond* with the electrons it receives.
