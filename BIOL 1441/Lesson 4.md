# Lesson 4 Notes
## Learning Objectives
__1. Explain why the human body needs to eat.__  
On the most basic level, you need to eat to get the 
energy required to survive  
• Energy is required for building **macromolecules** (like 
proteins & nucleic acids)  
• Energy is required for life-sustaining processes like active 
transport

__2. Define the term “metabolism”__    
**Metabolism** is the sum of all the chemical reactions that 
occur in your cells to keep you alive  

3. Describe the function of chemical bonds.
4. Explain how the structure of ATP makes it
good for storing & releasing energy.
5. Explain what happens in catabolic &
anabolic reactions.
6. Explain what happens in endergonic &
exergonic reactions.
7. Describe the relationship between
catabolic, anabolic, endergonic, and
exergonic reactions.
8. Explain how ATP & ADP are related.
9. Explain what happens during redox
reactions.
10. Write the overall chemical equation for
cellular respiration.
11. Identify the location where each step of
cellular respiration occurs in the cell.
12. Differentiate between substrate-level
phosphorylation & chemiosmosis.
13. List the number of carbons found in
glucose & pyruvate.
14. Identify the starting materials & products
created by each of these processes:
glycolysis, pyruvate oxidation, the Citric
Acid Cycle (a.k.a. Krebs Cycle), and the
Electron Transport Chain (and oxidative
phosphorylation).
15. Explain the function of electron carriers
in cellular respiration.
16. Explain how electrons are used to build a
proton gradient across the inner
mitochondrial membrane.
17. Explain how the movement of protons is
used to build ATP.
18. Describe the role of oxygen in the
process of cellular respiration.
19. Describe the purpose of fermentation.
20. Explain how alcohol & lactic acid
fermentation occur, including types of
organisms using each pathway
21. Explain the role of feedback inhibition in
regulating cellular respiration.

## Slide Notes
In **cellular respiration** the energy is transferred to the bonds between the phosphate groups ATP.

**ATP** can be used by cells as a source of energy by breaking the high-energy phosphate bonds.

The energy in glucose is stored in the chemical bonds between the atoms. It is not directly available for your cells to use.

## Homework Answers 
The **Citric Acid Cycle** (Krebs Cycle) builds ATP through **substrate-level phosphorylation**

Glycolysis starts with **glucose** and ends with **pyruvate**

In the chemical reaction above, Zn loses 2 electrons, transforming it into Zn^2+. This means that Zn was **oxidized** in this chemical reaction.


Pyruvate oxidation starts with **pyruvate**, and ends with **acetyl coenzyme A**

A chemical reaction that *builds* a large polymer from small monomers is called **an anabolic** reaction.
Because this *building* reaction requires energy, this kind of reaction would also be considered **endergonic**.

*Pyruvate* oxidation occurs **in the mitochondrial matrix**

O2 (Oxygen) required by the *mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain* **accepts low-energy electrons and forms water.**

**NAD+** electron carrier does **NOT** transport electrons
**NADH** electron carrier **DOES** transport electrons

**Fermentation** generates **more NAD+**

In a chemical reaction, the molecule that gets **reduced** will form a *new chemical bond* with the electrons it receives.
