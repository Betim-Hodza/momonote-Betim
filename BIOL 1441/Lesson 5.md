# Lesson 5 Notes

## Learning Objectives
1. **Explain how autotrophs & heterotrophs obtain their energy.**  
    Autotrophs (“self feeders”) are organisms that CAN build their own energy-rich macromolecules  
    • Photoautotrophs (like plants) use the energy of light to do this  
    • Chemoautotrophs (like some bacteria) use the energy of inorganic molecules (like sulfur or ammonia)  
2. **Write the overall chemical equation for photosynthesis.**  
    Energy + 6CO2 + 6H2O => C6H12O6 + 6O2  

3. **Identify which reaction words (anabolic / catabolic, endergonic / exergonic) accurately
describe photosynthesis.**  
  Photosynthesis is an **anabolic** process. Anabolic processes build complex molecules from simpler ones. In photosynthesis, simple molecules of water and carbon dioxide are assembled into glucose, a complex sugar, along with the production of oxygen. This synthesis of glucose involves the formation of new chemical bonds, demonstrating the constructive nature of anabolism.  
  
    Photosynthesis is an **endergonic** process. This means it requires an input of energy to proceed. The energy needed for photosynthesis comes from sunlight. In photosynthesis, light energy is captured by chlorophyll and used to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). The process stores energy in the chemical bonds of glucose, a form of potential energy that is higher than the energy of the reactants. Therefore, the reaction is non-spontaneous without the input of energy.  

4. **Identify the source of energy for photosynthesis.**  

5. **Name the locations of the light reactions & the Calvin Cycle in a plant cell.**  

6. **Describe the general functions of the light reactions & the Calvin Cycle in photosynthesis.**  

7. **Explain how the wavelength of light relates to its color & energy level.**  

8. **Explain why plants are green.**  

9. **Name the structures that are found in a photosystem.**  

10. **Explain how photosystems trap light energy.**  

11. **Identify the source of the excited electrons found in Photosystem II & Photosystem I.**  

12. **Explain how the light reactions of photosynthesis generate oxygen.**  

13. **Describe how the proton (H +) gradient across the thylakoid membrane is generated.**  

14. **Explain how the H+ gradient is used to generate ATP.**  

15. **List the products & reactants of the light reactions.**  

16. **Explain the relationship between the products of photosynthesis’ light reactions & the
reactants of the Calvin cycle.**  

17. **Explain what happens in carbon fixation.**  

18. **Name the enzyme that performs carbon fixation.**  

19. **Explain why 6 turns of the cycle is necessary to make 1 glucose.**  

20. **Explain how photosynthesis & cellular respiration are related to one another.**

**Autotrophs** (“self feeders”) are organisms that CAN build their own energy-rich macromolecules
**Photoautotrophs** (like plants) use the energy of light to do this ^
**Chemoautotrophs** (like some bacteria) use the energy of inorganic molecules (like sulfur or ammonia)

Because humans CANNOT make these molecules themselves, we are considered **heterotrophs** (“other feeders”) Animals, fungi, and most bacteria are also
heterotrophs.

**Photosynthesis** is the process used by plants to transform light energy (and carbon dioxide and water) into glucose

## Homework Answers
One "goal" of the **light reactions** of photosynthesis is to generate ATP.
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur **In the thylakoid membrane (of a chloroplast)**

**Rubisco** is the enzyme that performs carbon fixation.

**ATP Synthase** is the enzyme that uses the proton gradient to build ATP.

**Photosystems (I and II)** is the name of the complexes where light is used to energize electrons.

**Six** carbon dioxide (CO2) are needed to generate **one** new glucose molecule (C6H12O6)

Cellular respiration & Photosynthesis are connected to each other in that cellular respiration generates carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis.

*Oxygen* is made during the process of photosynthes when **Photosystem II** breaks down H2O to generate it.

The special electrons for **Photosystem I (PSI**) come from **Photosystem II (PSII)**

**G3P (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate)** is organic compound is the direct output of the Calvin cycle

A reactant (a.k.a. starting material) of the Calvin Cycle is **ATP**

Plants are an example of an organism that would be considered **an autotroph**
