## Slide Notes

**Autotrophs** (“self feeders”) are organisms that CAN build their own energy-rich macromolecules
**Photoautotrophs** (like plants) use the energy of light to do this ^
**Chemoautotrophs** (like some bacteria) use the energy of inorganic molecules (like sulfur or ammonia)

Because humans CANNOT make these molecules themselves, we are considered **heterotrophs** (“other feeders”) Animals, fungi, and most bacteria are also
heterotrophs.



## Homework Answers
One "goal" of the **light reactions** of photosynthesis is to generate ATP.
The light reactions of photosynthesis occur **In the thylakoid membrane (of a chloroplast)**

**Rubisco** is the enzyme that performs carbon fixation.

**ATP Synthase** is the enzyme that uses the proton gradient to build ATP.

**Photosystems (I and II)** is the name of the complexes where light is used to energize electrons.

**Six** carbon dioxide (CO2) are needed to generate **one** new glucose molecule (C6H12O6)

Cellular respiration & Photosynthesis are connected to each other in that cellular respiration generates carbon dioxide, which is used in photosynthesis.

*Oxygen* is made during the process of photosynthes when **Photosystem II** breaks down H2O to generate it.

The special electrons for **Photosystem I (PSI**) come from **Photosystem II (PSII)**

**G3P (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate)** is organic compound is the direct output of the Calvin cycle

A reactant (a.k.a. starting material) of the Calvin Cycle is **ATP**

Plants are an example of an organism that would be considered **an autotroph**
