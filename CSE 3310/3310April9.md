Test plan due wednesday the 17th

Best way of managing someone who doesn't do anything in a group, document it

* Next tuesday(16th) is plans for presentations
* Last 3 lectures is team presentations

## Three tier C/S Architecture (Client Server)

* Client
* Application Processing (server)
* Data Management (server)

For big companies (expensive to do)

## Distributed Object Architectures

* No distinction in a distribured object architectures between clients and servers
* each distributable entity is an object that provides services to other objects adn recieves services from objects
* Object communication is through a middleware system called an object request broker (ORB)
* Distributed object architectures are more complex to design than C/S systems

a diagram of this is similar to class objects

Exam questions: who handles the communication is distributed object architecture?

* ORB: Object Request Broker

## Advantages of Distributed object arch

* Allows the system designer to delay decisions
* very open
* allowed to use it as client server as well!

## Uses of distributed object Arch

* As a logical model its good
* and a client server
* Can be used in data mining systems
  * Data mining (comparing data with each other)
  * Integrators use deep learning to learn off the data
  * Kinda like how beer and baby products are next to each other
  
## CORBA (common object request broker architecture)

* Middleware for distributed computing 2 level
  * At the lgocial communication, allows object on diff computers to exchange data
  * At the component level provides a basis for delvoping compatable components
  
Exam questions:

What does corba stand for?

* CORBA (common object request broker architecture)

What is Corba Application structure (list or draw it)

* Application objects (Your own version of stuff / flavor / subroutines-api's)
* Domain Facilities (Display of information)
* Object Request Broker (Gathering information)
* CORBA Services  (runs and manages all the services)
* Horizontal CORBA facilities (Common services for each corba task / Fonts and colors)

Corba is the heart of Distributed object architectures

## Application Structure

* Application object
* This is defined by OMG

## Corba objects

* CORBA objects are comparable in principle to objects in C++ & java
* Corba objects must have a seperate interface definition that is expressed using a common language (IDL) similar to C++
* Interface Definition Languages (IDL)
* There is a mapping form IDL to programming languages
* Therefore objects wirtten in diffent languages can communicate with each other

## Peer-to-peer architecture

* Peer to peer (p2p) Systems are decentrailised systems where computations may be carried out by any node in the network
* The overall system is designed to take advantage of the computation power and storage of a large networked computers
* Most p2p systems have been personal system but there is increaing business use of this technology.

p2p communication is a lot like a game of telephone but the data is not lost!

## p2p architectural models

* The logical network arch.
  * Decentralised arch. ( each node just holds info and p2p has to repeat its process again)
  * semi-centralised arch. (semi-centralized has a discovery server where it saves some info that has been searched for before and shortens the search time)
* Application arch.
  * the generacic org of componets
* focus is on network architecutre

## Generic Service

* An act/performance offered by one party to another.
* Service probvison is therefore independent of the application using the service

## WEB SERVICES DIAGRAM (important for exam)

* Service registry
* Service requestor
* Service Provider

## Services and distrbuted objects

* Provider independence
* public advertising
* pay for use

All of these are written in soap (which soap is written in XML)

## service standards

* Services are based on agreed, XML-based standards, so they can provide on any platform in any lang.
* Key standards
  * SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol (message in an envolope
  * WSDL - WEb Services Description Language
  * UDDI - Universal Decription, Discovery and Integration
  
Exam question:

Draw xml diagram

what technologies included

what are they based on
