# CyberSecurity/Security Engineering

- Tools, techniques and methods to support the development and maintenance of systems that can resist malicious attacks that are intended to damage a computer system or its data
- Malicious software == Malware
- this is a subfield of the broader field of computer security

## Security Dimensions

- Confidentiality
  - Information in a system may be disclosed or made accessible to people or programs that are not authorized to have access to that info.
- Integrity
  - Information in a system may be damaged or corrupted making it unusual or unreliable.
- Availability
  - Access to a system or its data that is normally available may not be possible

## Security 

- The security of a system is a system property that reflects the sytems ability to protect itself from accidental or deliberate external attacks.
- Security is essential as most systems are networked so that external access to the system through the internet is possible.
- Security is an essential pre-requisite for avalibiltiy, reliability and safety.

## Security Terminology

Know these definitions

- Asset
  - Something of value which has to be protected.
- Attack
  - An exploitation of a systems vulnerability. Generally, this is from outside the system and is a deliberate attempt to cause some damage.
- Control
  - A protective measure that reduces a systems vulnerability. encryption is an example of control that reduces a vulnerabiltiy of weak access control system
- Exposure
  - Possible loss or harm to a computing system. This can be loss or damage to data, or time and effor to recovery after a security breach.
- Threat
  - Circumstances that have potential cuase loss or harm. (system vulnerabiltiy that is subjected to an attack)
- Vulnerabiltiy
  - A weakness in a computer-based system that may be exploited to cause loss or harm.

## Threat types (IMPORTANT)

Know these 

- Interception threats
  - Allows an attacker to gain access to an asset
- Interruption threats
  - Allows an attacker to make part of the system unavailable.
  - A possible threat might be (DoS) Denial of Service
  - A possible threat might be (DDoS) Distributed Denial of Service
- Modification Threats
  - Allow an attacker to tamper with system asset
  - E.g. attacker alters or destroys a user record 
- Fabrication threat
  - Allows an attacker to insert false information into a system
  - E.g. False transactions might be added to the system that trnasfers money to the perps bank account (or out of your bank account!)

## Types of security requirements (IMPORTANT)

- Identification
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Immunity (i.e. protection)
- Integrity 
- Intrustion Detection
- Non-repudiation (i.e. undeniable)
- Privacy
- Security Auditing
- System maintenance security

(these are all requirmenets)

## Security requirement classification (IMPORTANT)

- Risk:
  - Avoidance
    - risks that should be avoided by designing system so that hese risks cannot arise
  - Detection
    - Define mechanisms that identify risks if it does arise, and neutrilize the risk before loss
  - Mitigation
    - Set out how system should be designed so that it can recover from and restore sys. assets after loss has occurred
