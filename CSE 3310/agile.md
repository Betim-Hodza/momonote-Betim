# Agile Software Development

* Agile Methods
* Plan-driven and agile development
* Extreme Programming (XP)
* Refactoring
* Test First development
* Pair programming
* Scrum
* Scale agile methods

## Agile

Agile philosphy
- break the problem into many little problems and deal with them seperatly

## Rapid Development

- now the most important requirement for software systems

## Agile methods
* Distatisfaction with overheads involved in software design in 80s and 90s
  * focus on code rather design

## Agile manifesto (IMPORTANT)
That is while there is a vlaue in items on the rightm we value the items on the left more:

* Indivuals and interations over processess and tools
* Working software over comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
* Responding to change over following a plan

Question, which of the following is NOT apart of the manifestio (will take one of the 4 and flip them

## Princple of agile methods
* customer involvment: Customers should be closly involved throught development)
* Incremental delivery (sprints) 
* People not process
* Embrance change
* maintain simplicity

Story (like a requirement)

## Plan driven and agile development

Agile development == Light weight Approach

Waterfall Development == heavy weight approach

## 3 Agile Methodologies
* XP
* Scrum
* Kamban

## Extreme programming (XP)
* Takes extreme approach to iterative dev. 
  * New versions may be built several times per day
  * increments are delivered to customers every 2 weeks
  * All tests Must run  for every build and build is only accepted if tests run successfully

### XP practices
* Incremental Planning
* small releases
* simple design
* Test-first development (write tests then CODE)
* Refactoring: (fixing up the code to be better at the end, continuous optimization)
* Pair programming (checking each others work and providing the support to always do a good job)
* Collective ownership
* Continuous Integration: A-> AB-> ABC
* Sustainable Pace: Large amount of overtime is not considered acceptable, as net effect is often to reduce code quality and medium term productivity
* On-site customer: Customer should be available full time to use (not the best scrum does this differently)


## Scrum 
Exactly like XP, but 2 issues solved
* No onsight customer
* 2-4 week delieverables to customer

3 phrases in Scrum
* Outline planning: Initial phase is an outline planning where you establish the general objctives for project and design
* Sprint Series: This is folowed by a series of sprint cycles
* Closure: The project closure phase wraps up the project

(can be shown as a diagram seen in the slides)

### Sprint Cycle

* Sprints are fixed length, normally 2-4 weeks. They correspond to the development.
  * 2 weeks for normal, 4 weeks for larger parts

### Teamwork in scrum
Scrum Master:
* is a facilitator who arranges daily meetings, tracks teh backlog of work to be done, records decisions, measures progress against backlog and communicates with customers and managmement outside of the team.
* Ideal team size 7 +- 2 
* The whole team attends short daily meetings where all team members share info, describe progress since the last meetings, problems that have arisen (Called a DSM daily srum meetings)

Daily Standup(scrum but standup is better) Meeting DSM
* have to standup and have a 10-15 meetings quick

## Scaling Agile MEthods
* Agile methods have proved to be successful for small and medium sized projects
* It is sometimes argued that the success of these methods comes because of improved communications
* Can this be scaled up?

## Sclaing out and Scaling Up (IMPORTANTTT)

* Scaling up: Concerned with using agile methods for dev. large software systems that cannot be dev. by a small team.
* Scaling out: concerned with how agile methods can be introduced across a large organization with many years of software devlopment experience.
* When scaling agile methods it is essential to maintain agile fundamentals
  * Flexible palnning, frequent system releases, continuous integrationm test driven dev. and good team comm.

Scaling out: convincing people to use it in large companies
