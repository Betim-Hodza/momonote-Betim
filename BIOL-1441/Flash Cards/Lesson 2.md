## The Great Divide (and How to Cross It)

**1. Explain the fundamentals of atomic structures and define a bond.**  
A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms or ions.
A chemical bond enables the formation of molecules. 

**2. Explain the main function of a cellâ€™s plasma membrane.**  
Dividing the inside of a cell from its environment.
Only certain molecules can pass straight through it.


**3. Describe the functions of phospholipids & transport proteins in the plasma membrane.**  


**4. Identify the hydrophobic & hydrophilic regions of the phospholipid bilayer.**

**5. List the kinds of molecules that can & cannot diffuse across the membrane.**  

**6. Use the chemical properties of a molecule (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, polar, nonpolar, charged) to determine whether or not it could diffuse across the membrane.**

**7. Explain what a concentration gradient is.**  

**8. Use the direction of a concentration gradient to determine which way a molecule would move (into or out of a cell).** 

**9. Explain how passive transport is different from active transport.**

**10.Explain why active transport is important to a cell.**  

**11.Identify similarities & differences between these transport processes: diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis, primary active transport, secondary active transport.** 

**Two kinds of energy can be used in active transport** 
1. ATP
2. A concentration gradient  

**ATP**  
Stores energy in its chemical bonds  

**Concentration Gradient**  
As one molecule moves down, that movements pushes a different molecule up its own gradient.




**Primary Active Transport**  

**Sodium-potassium pump**  
Sodium is pumped out of the cell, even though a lot is *already* outside
Potassium is pumped *into* the cell, even though a lot is *already* inside

**Secondary Active Transport**  
movement down one concentration gradient is used to power movement up a *different* concentration gradient

**How is ATP involved in concentration gradients?**
