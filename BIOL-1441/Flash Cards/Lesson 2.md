# Objectives

**1. Explain the fundamentals of atomic structures and define a bond.**  
A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms or ions.
A chemical bond enables the formation of molecules. 

**2. Explain the main function of a cellâ€™s plasma membrane.**  
Dividing the inside of a cell from its environment.
Only certain molecules can pass straight through it.


**3. Describe the functions of phospholipids & transport proteins in the plasma membrane.**  


**4. Identify the hydrophobic & hydrophilic regions of the phospholipid bilayer.**

**5. List the kinds of molecules that can & cannot diffuse across the membrane.**  

**6. Use the chemical properties of a molecule (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, polar, nonpolar, charged) to determine whether or not it could diffuse across the membrane.**

**7. Explain what a concentration gradient is.**  

**8. Use the direction of a concentration gradient to determine which way a molecule would move (into or out of a cell).** 

**9. Explain how passive transport is different from active transport.**

**10.Explain why active transport is important to a cell.**  

**11.Identify similarities & differences between these transport processes: diffusion, facilitated diffusion, osmosis, primary active transport, secondary active transport.** 

# Quiz  

**When a molecule moves from an area of low concentration into an area of HIGH concentration, ____ transport is occuring.**  
active  

**How would nicotine, a polar molecule (found in tobacco), cross the plasma membrane of a cell?**  
It would use facilitated diffusion.  

**Which transport process is used to move water across the plasma membrane?**  
Osmosis  

**Which transport process is used to move large polar molecules across the plasma membrane?**  
Faciltated diffusion

**The image shows a beaker with two NaCl solutions (5% NaCl and 10% NaCl) separated by a semipermeable membrane. In which direction would water move?**  

**Which transport process uses the energy of one molecule moving DOWN its concentration gradient to power the movement of another molecule UP its concentration gradient?**  
Secondary active transport  

**Click on part of the plasma membrane that is considered hydrophobic.**  

**Which part of a phospholipid (in the plasma membrane) is directly touching the water outside of a cell?**  
The head of the phospholipid  

**When _____ transport occurs, energy is required.**  
active  

**How would estrogen, a hydrophobic hormone, cross the plasma membrane of a cell?**  
It would use simple diffusion.  

**How would lysine, a positively-charged amino acid, cross the plasma membrane of a cell?**  
It would use facilitated diffusion.  


**Which part of the plasma membrane is used to move charged ions (like Na+ or Cl-) across the plasma membrane?**  
Its transport proteins

**When _____ transport occurs, energy is NOT required**  
passive  

**Which part of the plasma membrane is most responsible for creating a hydrophobic barrier around a cell?**  
The tails of its phospholipids  

**Which part of the plasma membrane is used to move polar molecules (like glucose) across the plasma membrane?** 
Its transport proteins 

**When a molecule moves DOWN (a.k.a. with) its concentration gradient, _____ transport is occuring**  
passive  

**How would nicotine, a polar molecule (found in tobacco), cross the plasma membrane of a cell?**  
It would use facilitated diffusion.  


**The image shows a beaker with two NaCl solutions (20% NaCl and 5% NaCl) separated by a semipermeable membrane. In which direction would NaCl move?**  
NaCl would move out of the solution on the left and into the solution on the right.  

**Which transport process is used to move nonpolar gases straight through the plasma membrane?**  
Simple diffusion


# Lecture

**Two kinds of energy can be used in active transport** 
1. ATP
2. A concentration gradient  

**ATP**  
Stores energy in its chemical bonds  

**Concentration Gradient**  
As one molecule moves down, that movements pushes a different molecule up its own gradient.




**Primary Active Transport**  

**Sodium-potassium pump**  
Sodium is pumped out of the cell, even though a lot is *already* outside
Potassium is pumped *into* the cell, even though a lot is *already* inside

**Secondary Active Transport**  
movement down one concentration gradient is used to power movement up a *different* concentration gradient

**How is ATP involved in concentration gradients?**
