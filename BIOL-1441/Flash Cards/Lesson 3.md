**DNA is "copied" into mRNA.** 
The nucleus  

**mRNA is "read" and amino acids are attached to each other.**  
The ribosomes  

**The amino acid chain is modified and sent to its correct cellular location.**  


**The completed amino acid chain folds and moves through this organelle.**  
The rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER)  

**This large organelle detoxifies wastes and toxins, and builds lipids.**  
The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (smooth ER)  

**This organelle creates a semipermeable barrier around the cell.**  
The plasma membrane  

**These organelles use their digestive enzymes to break macromolecules and recycle worn-out organelles.**  
The lysosomes  

**This organelle modifies proteins and sorts them to their final locations.**  
The Golgi apparatus (a.k.a. Golgi body)  

**Which of these is something that both eukaryotic AND prokaryotic cells have?**  
(not a nucleus)  

**An animal cell needs a lot of ATP to be able to perform its daily functions. Which of these organelles would it need more of to meet this need?**  
Mitochondria  

**These organelles store excess materials (like water, glucose, or waste) in the cell.**  
The vacuoles  

**These long extensions outside a cell help to move the entire cell forward.**  
The flagella  

**This group of proteins gives a cell its shape and helps with intracellular movement.**  
The cytoskeleton  

**These SMALL organelles float in the cytoplasm & build proteins.**  
The ribosomes  

**This large organelle builds proteins.**  
The rough endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER)  

**These organelles perform photosynthesis and generate ATP.**  
The chloroplasts  

**Lysosomes are an organelle found**  
ONLY in animal cells
