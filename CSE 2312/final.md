# CSE 2312 FINAL

Final Is Comprehensive 

Theres not much to explain here besides that I had a departmental final when I did take this class. It was about 10-15 questions made by one of the main professors in these classes and it sucked. My professor didn't actually like it so I think that was the only test he curved for us!
