# Secure Programming  

## Description of Course Content
This course is an introduction to methods of secure software design and development for upper-level
undergraduate students and graduate students. Students will learn about the major security problems
found in software today. Using this knowledge, they will work to find these bugs in software, fix the bugs,
and design software so that it has fewer security problems. Static analysis tools will be a core part of the
class, but students will also be exposed to black box testing tools. Topics will include input validation,
buffer overflow prevention, error handling, web application issues, and XML. Prerequisites: CSE 3310
and CSE 3320, or equivalent.  


## Student Learning Outcomes
The student should understand the principles necessary to develop secure software within the larger
context of System Security Engineering. In addition, the student will have the opportunity to apply their
understanding of secure software development principles using static code analysis (both manual and
automated) as well as implementation and exploitation of vulnerabilities that are the result of poor
programming practices.
