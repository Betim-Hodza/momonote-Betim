The learning objective of this lab is for students to get a first-hand experience on buffer-overflow vulnerability by putting what they have learned about the vulnerability from class into action.

Use the following values in the Makefile for building the vulnerable program (these affect BUF_SIZE in the program):

- L1 = 130
- L2 = 150
- L3 = 170
- L4 = 10
