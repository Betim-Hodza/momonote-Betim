# Software vs Application Security

# System Weakness (from the "safety domain") ***

Bugs

Flaws

Defects encompass both implementation (bugs) and design (flaws) problems  
* May lie dormat for years and surface later in a fielded system  
* Give way to major consequences

*There was a flaw in the requirements. A defect in the design in the design or the requirements can lead to an issue int he system as built*  

# Security Definition ***  
*If a system has a vulnerability, given that it's being deployed in a hostile environment. The internet is a highly hostile environment. What is it's ability to withstand the effects?*  

Basic definition of Vulnerability  

Cyber Vulnerability (CISSP BoK)
1. A flaw* (aka weakness) exists in the system  
2. Attacker has access to the flaw, and  
3. Attack has capability to exploit the flaw  
    * Examples
        - Lack of security 
        - Lack of current virus definitions  
        - Software Bug  
        - Lax physical security


# The Software Security Problem

# Security Features != Secure Features  

# Unintended Functionality 

# Penetration Test  

# Software Development Phase

# Maintenance Phase
*I can have a system that is functionally behaving as expected, but the environment around it has changed*
*For example, we have an OS with no vulnerability defects. Next week, someone has discovered a new vulnerability. We now have a zero day. The environment has changed*

*If I can't tell you how many failed logins I've had over the past week, then I'm not auditing*

# The Seven Pernicious Kingdoms

# Input Validation and Representation *** 

# API Abuse

# Security Features

# Time and State  
*It's hard to make a system deterministic these days*

# Code Quality
