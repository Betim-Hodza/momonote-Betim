Betim's Recommendation
* I'd much rather compile using WSL2/VScode rather than VM 
  * This here is a  <a href='https://mavsuta.sharepoint.com/sites/cse13xx/SitePages/Visual-Studio-Code.aspx'>UTA Student only link</a> only link to install WSL2 Ubuntu
  * I'll also make another page on my steps on installing it as well
* Donna Frenches class is mostly quizzes, so be prepared for weekly OLQ's and study for them!
