# Task 8
## Question  

Consider the following PDDL state description for the Blocks world problem.

On(A, B)
On(B, C)
On(C, Table)
On(D, E)
On(D, Table)

Consider the definition of Move(block, from, to) as given in the slides

Can you perform action Move(A, B, D) in this state.

What is the outcome of performing this action in this state.

## Answer

To determine whether the action `Move(A, B, D)` can be performed in the given state of the Blocks world and what the outcome would be, we need to consider the preconditions for the `Move` action and the state of the world before and after the action.

In the Blocks world, the typical preconditions for a `Move(block, from, to)` action are:
1. `block` is clear (i.e., no other block is on top of it).
2. `from` is the current location of `block`.
3. `to` is clear (i.e., no other block is on top of it) and different from `from`.
4. `block` is not the same as `to`.

Given the state description:
- On(A, B)
- On(B, C)
- On(C, Table)
- On(D, E)
- On(E, Table)

Let's analyze whether the action `Move(A, B, D)` can be performed:

1. **A is clear**: True, as there is no block on top of A.
2. **A is on B**: True, as stated in the state description.
3. **D is clear**: False, since E is on top of D.
4. **A is not D**: True.

Since one of the preconditions (D being clear) is not satisfied, the action `Move(A, B, D)` cannot be performed in this state.

If we hypothetically ignore the precondition that "D must be clear", and still perform the action, the resulting state would be:
- A is now on D.
- B is clear.
- C, E, and Table remain unchanged.

So, the new state would be:
- On(A, D)
- On(B, Table) (since A was moved from B)
- On(C, Table)
- On(D, E)
- On(E, Table)

But, it's important to note that in the real Blocks world problem as traditionally defined, this action would not be allowed due to the violation of the preconditions.
