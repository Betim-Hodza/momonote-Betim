etc.  

**agent function**  
maps from percept histories to actions  
f : P*->A  

**agent program**  
Runs on the physical **architecture** to produce f  

**fixed performance measure**  
evaluates the environment sequence  

**rational agent**  
chooses whichever action maximizes the expected value of the performance measure given the percept sequence to date  

**rational =/ omniscient**  
Percepts may not supply all relevant informtion  

**rational =/ clairvoyant**  
Action outcomes may not be as expected  

**rational =/**  
1. Omniscient
