## What is AI
**Acting like Humans**  
Turing Test (Imitation Game) - Alan Turing (1950)
- Suggested major components of AI
1. Knowledge
reasoning
language understanding
learning
- Still relevant today but not really useful

*Have we "achieved AI"?*
Not really. 
When we aks assistants like Siri a question, it first has to perform voice recognization. Then natural langauge processing, like the ums and ahs from your query. Then it must send to a server to choose from a large number of responses. Then it has to put together a response that is most appropriate for your query.
It is not an AI, it simply learning over the time the best response to your question.


**Thinking like Humans**  
To build such a system we need to know how the brain works
- What level of abstraction?
- How to validate the system
Predicting and testing human behavior (Cognitive Science)
Identify from neurological data (Cognitive Neuroscience)  
- These are approaches now considered distinct from AI
