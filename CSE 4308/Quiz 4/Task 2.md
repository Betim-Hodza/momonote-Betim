# Task 2

In a certain probability problem, we have 11 variables: A, B1, B2, ..., B10.

    Variable A has 7 values.
    Each of variables B1, ..., B10 have 8 possible values. Each Bi is conditionally indepedent of all other 9 Bjvariables (with j != i) given A.

Based on these facts:

Part a: How many numbers do you need to store in the joint distribution table of these 11 variables?

Part b: What is the most space-efficient way (in terms of how many numbers you need to store) representation for the joint probability distribution of these 11 variables? How many numbers do you need to store in your solution? Your answer should work with any variables satisfying the assumptions stated above.

Part c: Does this scenario follow the Naive-Bayes model?
