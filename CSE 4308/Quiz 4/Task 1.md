# Task 1

Consider the given joint probabilty distribution for a domain of two variables (Color, Vehicle) :

|                 | Color = Red | Color = Green | Color = Blue |
|-----------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Vehicle = Car   | 0.1184      | 0.1280        | 0.0736       |
| Vehicle = Van   | 0.0444      | 0.0480        | 0.0276       |
| Vehicle = Truck | 0.1554      | 0.1680        | 0.0966       |
| Vehicle = SUV   | 0.0518      | 0.0560        | 0.0322       |


Part a: Calculate P ( Color is not Green | Vehicle is Truck )

Part b: Check if Vehicle and Color are totally independant from each other
